# PyBoss

You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. Your script will need to do the following:

* Import the `employee_data1.csv` and `employee_data2.csv` files, which currently holds employee records like the below:

```csv
Emp ID,Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah Simpson,1985-12-04,282-01-8166,Florida
15,Samantha Lara,1993-09-08,848-80-7526,Colorado
411,Stacy Charles,1957-12-20,658-75-8526,Pennsylvania
```

* Then convert and export the data to use the following format instead:

```csv
Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL
15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO
411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA
```
